headless gpu passthrough install script

This is a helper script with some fancy grepping and variable declaration to make quick work of setting up a vfio gpu passthrough system. Be warned this script is incomplete and will remove your display from your system, do not use unless you know what you are doing...

I repeat, this script will break your system if you don't know what your are doing...
